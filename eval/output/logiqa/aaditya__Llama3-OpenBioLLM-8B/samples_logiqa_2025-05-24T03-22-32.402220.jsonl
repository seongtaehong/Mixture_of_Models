If we do not follow some pre-existing regulations or standards, how can we judge right and wrong?\nB. \"People are doing, heaven is watching. \" Failure to act in accordance with ethical regulations will incur punishment from heaven.\nC. Behind the judgment of right and wrong, you can always find the rules or standards on which people judge.\nD.
