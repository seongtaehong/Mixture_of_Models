Editorial: The structure of the present school calendar was established to satisfy the requirements of early-twentieth-century agricultural life. In those days, farmers needed their children to have long breaks during which they could remain at home and help with the harvest. The contemporary school year is thus made up of periods of study interspersed with long breaks. But agricultural life no longer occupies most of our citizens, so we can now make changes that serve the interests of children. Therefore, long breaks should be removed from the school calendar.Q: Which one of the following is an assumption on which the editorial's argument depends? Answer Choices: (A)During long breaks children have a tendency to forget what they have learned. (B)Children of farmers need to continue observing a school calendar made up of periods of study interspersed with long breaks. (C)Long breaks in the school calendar should be replaced with breaks that are no longer than workers' average vacations. (D)A change in the present school calendar that shortened breaks would serve the interests of agricultural life. (E)A school calendar made up of periods of study without long breaks would serve the interests of children more than a school calendar with long breaks.

Is it necessary for defense lawyers to believe that the clients they defend are innocent of the charges against them? Some legal scholars hold that lawyers' sole obligation is to provide the best defense they are capable of, claiming that in democratic societies all people accused of crimes are entitled to the best possible legal representation. They argue that lawyers have no right to judge defendants because it is the job of the courts to determine guilt or innocence and the job of the lawyer to represent the defendant before the court. They believe that the lawyer's responsibility is to state those facts that will assist each client's case, construct sound arguments based on these facts, and identify flaws in the arguments of opposing counsel. According to these scholars, the lawyer's role is not to express or act on personal opinions but to act as an advocate, saying only what defendants would say if they possessed the proper training or resources with which to represent themselves. But such a position overlooks the fact that the defense lawyer's obligation is twofold: to the defendant, certainly, but no less so to the court and, by extension, to society. For this reason, lawyers, great as their obligation to defendants is, should not, as officers of the court, present to the court assertions that they know to be false. But by the same principle, lawyers who are convinced that their clients are guilty should not undertake to demonstrate their innocence. Guilty defendants should not be entitled to false or insincere representation. When lawyers know with certainty that a defendant is guilty, it is their duty not to deny this. Rather, they should appraise the case as much as possible in their client's favor, after giving due consideration to the facts on the other side, and then present any extenuating circumstances and argue for whatever degree of leniency in sentencing they sincerely believe is warranted. In cases where it is uncertain whether the client is guilty but the lawyer sincerely believes the client may well be innocent, the lawyer should of course try to prove that the client is innocent. The lawyer's obligation to the court and to society also ultimately benefits the defendant, because the "best defense" can only truly be provided by an advocate who, after a careful analysis of the facts, is convinced of the merits of the case. The fact that every client is entitled to a defense does not mean that defense lawyers should take every case they are offered. Lawyers should not be mere mouthpieces for a defendant but instead advocates for the rights of the defendant given the facts of the case.Q: Which one of the following most accurately expresses the main idea of the passage? Answer Choices: (A)Some legal scholars defend a morally questionable view that defense lawyers' sole obligation to their clients is to provide the best defense, while it is the court's job to determine guilt or innocence. (B)Defense lawyers should put aside personal judgments about their clients' guilt when determining how best to proceed when representing a client. (C)In a democracy, all persons accused of crimes have a right to an attorney who will state the facts, construct sound arguments, and identify flaws in the arguments of opposing counsel. (D)Lawyers should be mindful of their duty to society as well as to their clients and base the decision as to whether, and how, to defend a client on the facts of the case. (E)Defense attorneys are obligated to defend clients who request their professional services, especially when the attorney is absolutely convinced of the client's innocence.

They believe that the lawyer's responsibility is to state those facts that will assist each client's case, construct sound arguments based on these facts, and identify flaws in the arguments of opposing counsel. According to these scholars, the lawyer's role is not to express or act on personal opinions but to act as an advocate, saying only what defendants would say if they possessed the proper training or resources with which to represent themselves. But such a position overlooks the fact that the defense lawyer's obligation is twofold: to the defendant, certainly, but no less so to the court and, by extension, to society. For this reason, lawyers, great as their obligation to defendants is, should not, as officers of the court, present to the court assertions that they know to be false. But by the same principle, lawyers who are convinced that their clients are guilty should not undertake to demonstrate their innocence. Guilty defendants should not be entitled to false or insincere representation. When lawyers know with certainty that a defendant is guilty, it is their duty not to deny this. Rather, they should appraise the case as much as possible in their client's favor, after giving due consideration to the facts on the other side, and then present any extenuating circumstances and argue for whatever degree of leniency in sentencing they sincerely believe is warranted. In cases where it is uncertain whether the client is guilty but the lawyer sincerely believes the client may well be innocent, the lawyer should of course try to prove that the client is innocent. The lawyer's obligation to the court and to society also ultimately benefits the defendant, because the "best defense" can only truly be provided by an advocate who, after a careful analysis of the facts, is convinced of the merits of the case. The fact that every client is entitled to a defense does not mean that defense lawyers should take every case they are offered. Lawyers should not be mere mouthpieces for a defendant but instead advocates for the rights of the defendant given the facts of the case.Q: Which one of the following most accurately expresses the main idea of the passage? Answer Choices: (A)Some legal scholars defend a morally questionable view that defense lawyers' sole obligation to their clients is to provide the best defense, while it is the court's job to determine guilt or innocence. (B)Defense lawyers should put aside personal judgments about their clients' guilt when determining how best to proceed when representing a client. (C)In a democracy, all persons accused of crimes have a right to an attorney who will state the facts, construct sound arguments, and identify flaws in the arguments of opposing counsel. (D)Lawyers should be mindful of their duty to society as well as to their clients and base the decision as to whether, and how, to defend a client on the facts of the case. (E)Defense attorneys are obligated to defend clients who request their professional services, especially when the attorney is absolutely convinced of the client's innocence.

They believe that the lawyer's responsibility is to state those facts that will assist each client's case, construct sound arguments based on these facts, and identify flaws in the arguments of opposing counsel. According to these scholars, the lawyer's role is not to express or act on personal opinions but to act as an advocate, saying only what defendants would say if they possessed the proper training or resources with which to represent themselves. But such a position overlooks the fact that the defense lawyer's obligation is twofold: to the defendant, certainly, but no less so to the court and, by extension, to society. For this reason, lawyers, great as their obligation to defendants is, should not, as officers of the court, present to the court assertions that they know to be false. But by the same principle, lawyers who are convinced that their clients are guilty should not undertake to demonstrate their innocence. Guilty defendants should not be entitled to false or insincere representation. When lawyers know with certainty that a defendant is guilty, it is their duty not to deny this. Rather, they should appraise the case as much as possible in their client's favor, after giving due consideration to the facts on the other side, and then present any extenuating circumstances and argue for whatever degree of leniency in sentencing they sincerely believe is warranted. In cases where it is uncertain whether the client is guilty but the lawyer sincerely believes the client may well be innocent, the lawyer should of course try to prove that the client is innocent. The lawyer's obligation to the court and to society also ultimately benefits the defendant, because the "best defense" can only truly be provided by an advocate who, after a careful analysis of the facts, is convinced of the merits of the case. The fact that every client is entitled to a defense does not mean that defense lawyers should take every case they are offered. Lawyers should not be mere mouthpieces for a defendant but instead advocates for the rights of the defendant given the facts of the case.Q: Which one of the following most accurately expresses the main idea of the passage? Answer Choices: (A)Some legal scholars defend a morally questionable view that defense lawyers' sole obligation to their clients is to provide the best defense, while it is the court's job to determine guilt or innocence. (B)Defense lawyers should put aside personal judgments about their clients' guilt when determining how best to proceed when representing a client. (C)In a democracy, all persons accused of crimes have a right to an attorney who will state the facts, construct sound arguments, and identify flaws in the arguments of opposing counsel. (D)Lawyers should be mindful of their duty to society as well as to their clients and base the decision as to whether, and how, to defend a client on the facts of the case. (E)Defense attorneys are obligated to defend clients who request their professional services, especially when the attorney is absolutely convinced of the client's innocence.

Akira came directly, breaking all tradition. Was that it? Had he followed form-had he asked his mother to speak to his father to approach a  go-between-would Chie have been more receptive?He came on a winter's eve. He pounded on the door while a cold rain beat on the shuttered veranda, so at first Chie thought him only the wind. The maid knew better. Chie heard her soft scuttling footsteps, the creak of the door. Then the maid brought acalling card to the drawing room, for Chie.Chie was reluctant to go to her guest; perhaps she was feeling too cozy. She and Naomi were reading at a low table set atop a charcoal brazier. A thick quilt spread over the sides of the table so their legs were  tucked inside with the heat."Who is it at this hour, in this weather?" Chie questioned as she picked the name card off the maid's lacquer tray."Shinoda, Akira. Kobe Dental College," she read.  Naomi recognized the name. Chie heard a soft intake of air."I think you should go," said Naomi. twenties, slim and serious, wearing the blackmilitary-style uniform of a student. As he bowed-his hands hanging straight down, a black cap in one, a yellow oil-paper umbrella in the other-Chie glanced beyond him. In the glistening surface of the courtyard's rain-drenched paving 30 stones, she saw his reflection like a dark double."Madame," said Akira, "forgive my disruption, but I come with a matter of urgency."His voice was soft, refined. He straightened and stole a deferential peek at her face.35 In the dim light his eyes shone with sincerity. Chie felt herself starting to like him."Come inside, get out of this nasty night. Surely your business can wait for a moment or two.""I don't want to trouble you. Normally I would 40 approach you more properly but I've received word of a position. I've an opportunity to go to America, as dentist for Seattle's Japanese community.""Congratulations," Chie said with amusement. "That is an opportunity, I'm sure. But how am I 45 involved?"Even noting Naomi's breathless reaction to the name card, Chie had no idea. Akira's message, delivered like a formal speech, filled her with maternal amusement. You know how children speak50 so earnestly, so hurriedly, so endearingly about things that have no importance in an adult's mind? That's how she viewed him, as a child. It was how she viewed Naomi. Even though Naomi was eighteen and training endlessly in the arts 55 needed to make a good marriage, Chie had made no effort to find her a husband.Akira blushed."Depending on your response, I may stay in Japan. I've come to ask for Naomi's hand."60 Suddenly Chie felt the dampness of the night."Does Naomi know anything of your... ambitions?""We have an understanding. Please don't judge my candidacy by the unseemliness of this proposal. I65 ask directly because the use of a go-between takes much time. Either method comes down to the same thing: a matter of parental approval. If you give your consent, I become Naomi's yoshi. ${ }^{*}$ We'll live in the House of Fuji. Without your consent, I must go to 70 America, to secure a new home for my bride."Eager to make his point, he'd been looking her full in the face. Abruptly, his voice turned gentle. "I see I've startled you. My humble apologies. I'll take no more of your evening. My address is on my card. If 75 you don't wish to contact me, I'll reapproach you in two weeks' time. Until then, good night."He bowed and left. Taking her ease, with effortless grace, like a cat making off with a fish."Mother?" Chie heard Naomi's low voice and 80 turned from the door. "He has asked you?"The sight of Naomi's clear eyes, her dark brows gave Chie strength. Maybe his hopes were preposterous."Where did you meet such a fellow? Imagine! $\mathrm{He}$ 85 thinks he can marry the Fuji heir and take her to America all in the snap of his fingers!"Chie waited for Naomi's ripe laughter.Naomi was silent. She stood a full half minute looking straight into Chie's eyes. Finally, she spoke.90 "I met him at my literary meeting."Naomi turned to go back into the house, then stopped."Mother.""Yes?"95 "I mean to have him."\begin{itemize}\item a man who marries a woman of higher status and takes her family's name\end{itemize}Q: Which choice best describes what happens in the passage?
